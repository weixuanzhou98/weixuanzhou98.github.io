About me
======
I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Civil and Enviromental Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Mohammed Quddus](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/m.quddus). My research interests are in the areas of intelligent transportation system (ITS), connected and autonomous vehicle, platooning, lane management strategies and driving behaviour models.

I received my master's and bachelor's degree in [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/eng/), supervised by [Prof. Xuesong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qPNyQCsAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focus was on vulnerable roader user safety, collsion avoidance algorithms and naturalistic driving study.
