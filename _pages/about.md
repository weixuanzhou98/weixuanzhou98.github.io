About me
======
:school: I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Civil and Enviromental Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Mohammed Quddus](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/m.quddus). My PhD project focuses on developing new methodologies to introduce connected and autonomous vehicles on UK [Strategic Road Network](https://nationalhighways.co.uk/our-roads/roads-we-manage/), which is funded by [National Highways](https://nationalhighways.co.uk/). My research interests are in the areas of intelligent transportation system (ITS), connected and autonomous vehicle, platooning, lane management strategies and driving behaviour models.

:mortar_board: Before joining Imperial, I received my master's degree in [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/eng/) in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Xuesong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qPNyQCsAAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis focused on developing AV collision avoidance algorithms in conflict scenarios between motorized and non-motorized vehicles. I also worked in [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) Shanghai R&D center as safety intern and associate active safety analysis Engineer from 2022 to 2023.
