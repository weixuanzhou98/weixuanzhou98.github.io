The rising volume of traffic is causing significant congestion on the UK Strategic Road Network (SRN). Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer promising improvements in traffic efficiency and safety, but the infrastructure-based strategy of introducing CAVs on SRN has yet to be fully explored. This study assesses three lane management strategies and examines an innovative CAV reversible lane strategy that leverages both vehicle eligibility and access control to increase capacity. Using the traffic microsimulation approach, the proposed strategy was evaluated on a UK motorway segment based on key performance indicators such as average delay, average speed and traffic conflicts. Scenarios relating to increase in traffic demand and CAV market penetration rates (MPR) satisfying the projected short to medium term traffic growth were tested. The results indicate that implementing a CAV reversible lane on a section of a motorway significantly improves overall traffic efficiency in the dominant traffic flow direction. Specifically, it reduces the average delay by 3.53 seconds per vehicle per kilometer and increases the average speed by 6.95 km/h. Additionally, it effectively manages the growing traffic demand without compromising safety. This study highlights the potential of CAV reversible lanes in mitigating congestion and suggests directions for future research, including large-scale studies and field tests and emphasises the importance of human factors in model transferability.
